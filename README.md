# My emacs init repo
This is a repo for storing and sharing my emacs init file, I create my init file structure mainly based on [Purcell's init file](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d)
and [margnar's init file](https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d).  
This init file is mainly for python-programming and markdown-text.
